<b>Frontend</b> : HTML, CSS

The website, About Me, was developed as a part of COEN 315 - Web Architecture and Protocols course at Santa Clara University, California in Winter 2023. The main focus was on setting up a domain and hosting the website by creating an Amazon EC2 instance. An apache2 server was setup on the EC2 instance in order to host the website.
