        I worked as a Project Engineer <a href="https://www.wipro.com/" style="color: rgb(39, 181, 39);">@Wipro Technologies</a>, Bangalore, India.<br><br>
        During the 2 years that I worked here, I primarily handled the internal database and its functionalities implemented in SQL. 
        My contribution to the compliance procedures of <b>Global Immigration Management</b> solved and improved the visualizations of the data on dashboards monitored by country heads. 
        Resolving issues related to the data, developing SQL procedures and maintenance of the Power BI dashboards enhanced my conceptual, analytical and logical skills.
        <br><br>While developing the complete dashboard for Travel and Hospitality, I successfully built the database and functionalities from <b>nil to 80%</b> and assisted in designing the powerBI dashboard. Persevering through challenges related to the cleaning of the data, I setup the format for future data insertions which reduced the manual workings by 70%. The role gave me an opportunity to sharpen my technical and problem-solving skills.
